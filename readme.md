# Pong

This is a simple Pong game written in Python using the Turtle library.

Future Updates: generate a random RGB color for the ball

## How to play

The game is played by two players, one controlling the paddle on the left side of the screen(W and S) and the other controlling the paddle on the right side(Up and Down). The goal of the game is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle and into their goal.

The ball bounces off the walls and the paddles. If the ball goes past a paddle, the opponent scores a point.

## How to run the code

Once you have Python installed,to run the game, you can use the following command: python main.py

The game will be displayed in a new window. You can then use the arrow keys to move the pong around the screen and play the game.

## Requirements

Turtle graphics library
The Turtle graphics documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html | Turtle graphics comes preinstalled with python, if for some reason it is not, you can install the graphics library by running the following command: pip install PythonTurtle

## Classes

The code uses the following classes:

- `Scoreboard` - This class represents the scoreboard. It keeps track of the score for each player and updates the scoreboard accordingly.
- `Ball` - This class represents the ball. It moves around the screen and bounces off the walls and paddles.
- `Paddle` - This class represents a paddle. It moves up and down the screen.

## Tips

Try to bounce the ball into your opponents goal to score points.
Be careful not to hit.
If you hit the walls your opponent will gain a point.
